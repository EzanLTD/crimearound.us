                    CrimeAround.us allows you to filter on different crime report attributes.
                </p>

                <h4 id='date-reported'><i class='fa fa-calendar'></i> Date reported</h4>
                <p>The date the crime occurred. We have reports going back to Jan 1st, 2001. Be warned, searching over multiple years may take a while to process.</p>

                <h4 id='crime-type'><i class='fa fa-navicon'></i> Crime type</h4>
                <p>Each crime is classified as one of 30 different types, such as <a href='/#date__lte=1391666399&date__gte=1390975200&primary_type=ASSAULT'>Assault</a>, <a href='/#date__lte=1391666399&date__gte=1390975200&primary_type=NARCOTICS'>Narcotics</a>, or <a href='/#date__lte=1391666399&date__gte=1357020000&primary_type=PROSTITUTION'>Prostitution</a>. For more detail, see the <a href='http://gis.chicagopolice.org/clearmap/crime_types.html'>full definition list</a> on the Chicago Police Department ClearPath website.</p>

                <p>Also, for each incident, multiple offenses can be reported, but the data we get only reveals most serious offense.</p>

                <p>We also group crime types in to <strong class='violent'>violent crimes</strong>, <strong class='property'>property crimes</strong> and <strong class='quality'>quality of life crimes</strong> in the same way that the <a href='http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/faq#community-type-definition'>Chicago Tribune does</a>. In order to accomodate all of the other categories of crime that these three buckets do not cover, we also added an <strong class="other">other</strong> category.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong class='violent'>Violent crimes</strong> - assault, battery, homicide, robbery, sexual assault</li>
                    <li><strong class='property'>Property crimes</strong> - arson, burglary, motor vehicle theft, theft</li>
                    <li><strong class='quality'>Quality of life crimes</strong> - criminal damage, narcotics, prostitution</li>
                    <li><strong class='other'>Other crimes</strong> - criminal trespass, deceptive practice, gambling, interference with a public officer, intimidation, kidnapping, liquor law violation, non-criminal, obscenity, other offense, other narcotic violation, public indecency, public peace violation, ritualism, sex offense, stalking, weapons violation</li>
